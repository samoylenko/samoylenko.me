# What is Application Security?

Let's not waste your time: **Application Security is DevOps, DevOps is
Application Security**. That's how you get there.

Technically, I can no longer tell the difference between security issues and
other software bugs, both in design and code. Just priority and complexity maybe
\- and that's what I base my next statement on:

**Application security engineers are software engineers**. They bring value by
taking on the complexity of security components in the application so that
development teams can focus on what they do best: enabling the business and
helping the client.

## What is a secure application?

Someone at a [Security Weekly](https://securityweekly.com/) podcast said:

>  A secure application is an application that only does what it was designed to
>  do and nothing else

Please help me find the original statement. Don't know who said this, but this
is the best definition I could find.

## What is an application security issue (vulnerability)?

Security issues are unplanned, undesired, unexpected application behavior.

## Where does this unexpected behavior come from?

It comes from what is completely normal and natural to all humans - exercising
our right to make mistakes and not always be perfect at everything.

## What causes software developers to make more mistakes?

1.  ["Reinventing the wheel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel)
    \- taking on work (and responsibility) for complex and large items that are
    out of the original project scope.

2.  Not leveraging other people help in decisions, designs, and reviews (and not
    investing in the collaborating environment).

3.  Not sharing enough information with other people so that they can make
    better decisions/

## A couple of simple questions that help prevent human mistakes.

1.  Is the problem I am solving entirely new to the world, with thousands of
    years of history, and it wasn't solved by someone already? For example, do
    companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple face this problem, too, and
    haven't solved it yet?

2.  If companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft haven't solved this problem
    with all their resources, money, and brilliant engineers, do I have
    everything I need to do that?

Please do let me know if you got 'yes' to both the questions - I know some
wealthy people who are looking for you day and night, ready to invest millions
of dollars.
